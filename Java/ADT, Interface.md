### Abstract Data Type (ADT):
An ADT is a mathematical model of a data structure. It defines the data and the operations that can be performed on the data but doesn't provide any implementation details.
An ADT specifies what operations are to be performed but not how these operations are implemented.
Examples include Stack, Queue, List, Set, Map, etc.

### Interface:
An interface, in the context of programming, is a contract or a blueprint for a class. It declares the methods a class should implement.
In many programming languages like Java, an interface is a type definition construct that allows the definition of the signatures of methods.

### Relationship:
An **interface can be used to define an ADT**
