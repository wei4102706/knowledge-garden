## Package
Use the package keyword at the first line in Java file:
```
package com.example.myfirstpackage;
```

Use `import` to use a package with simple name
##### Package Naming Conventions
- Generally, package names are written in all lower-case to avoid conflict with class names.
- Use domain name(internet address) in reverse as a prefix for the package name to ensure uniqueness.
```
package com.companyname.projectname.module;
```
For example, the JUnit library is hosted at `junit.org`, so the package is called `org.junit`
